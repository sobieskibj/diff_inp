# Diffusion Generative Models and Inpainting Techniques

This repository, based largely on the code from the [score_sde](https://github.com/yang-song/score_sde_pytorch) paper, aims at providing a comprehensive introduction to diffusion models and their application to the problem of inpainting in the form of a Jupyter [notebook](AAA_notebook.ipynb).
